# Presentation about FreeRTOS for IA158 subject at FI MU Brno

I prepared this presentation and all the materials in my free time and I am publishing this presentation including videos and source codes under the [MIT license](/LICENSE).

Mr. Br√°zdil asked me to create this presentation about Free RTOS for IA158 subject, because I was missing some practical examples in his presentation from 2018. Unfortunately, he never used this new presentation in his lectures and my effort was wasting of time.
